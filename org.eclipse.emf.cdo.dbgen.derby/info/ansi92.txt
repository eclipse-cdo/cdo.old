Data types
CHAR(n) 	Character string of fixed string length n.
VARCHAR(n) 	Variable-length character string with a maximum string length n.
LONG VARCHAR 	Variable length character data. Maximum length depends on used DBMS.
DECIMAL(p,s) 	Signed, exact, numeric value with a precision of at least p and scale s. (The maximum precision is driver-defined.) (1 <= p <= 15; s <= p).
NUMERIC(p,s) 	Signed, exact, numeric value with a precision p and scale s (1 <= p <= 15; s <= p).
SMALLINT 	Exact numeric value with precision 5 and scale 0 (signed: –32,768 <= n <= 32,767, unsigned: 0<= n <= 65,535).
INTEGER 	

Exact numeric value with precision 10 and scale 0 (signed: –2[31] <= n <= 2[31] – 1, unsigned: 0 <= n <= 2[32] – 1).
REAL 	Signed, approximate, numeric value with a binary precision 24 (zero or absolute value 10[–38] to 10[38]).
FLOAT(p) 	Signed, approximate, numeric value with a binary precision of at least p. (The maximum precision is driver-defined.)
DOUBLEPRECISION 	Signed, approximate, numeric value with a binary precision 53 (zero or absolute value 10[–308] to 10[308]).
BIT 	Single bit binary data.
TINYINT 	Exact numeric value with precision 3 and scale 0 (signed: –128 <= n <= 127, unsigned: 0<= n <= 255).
BIGINT 	Exact numeric value with precision 19 (if signed) or 20 (if unsigned) and scale 0 (signed: –2[63] <= n <= 2[63] – 1, unsigned: 0 <= n <= 2[64] – 1).
BINARY(n) 	Binary data of fixed length n.
VARBINARY(n) 	Variable length binary data of maximum length n. The maximum is set by the user.
LONG VARBINARY 	Variable length binary data. Maximum length is data source–dependent.
DATE 	Year, month, and day fields, conforming to the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
TIME(p) 	Hour, minute, and second fields, with valid values for hours of 00 to 23, valid values for minutes of 00 to 59, and valid values for seconds of 00 to 61. Precision p indicates the seconds precision.
TIMESTAMP(p) 	Year, month, day, hour, minute, and second fields, with valid values as defined for the DATE and TIME data types.
INTERVAL MONTH(p) 	Number of months between two dates; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL YEAR(p) 	Number of years between two dates; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL YEAR(p) TO MONTH 	Number of years and months between two dates; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL DAY(p) 	Number of days between two dates; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL HOUR(p) 	Number of hours between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL MINUTE(p) 	Number of minutes between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL SECOND(p,q) 	Number of seconds between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision and q is the interval seconds precision.
INTERVAL DAY(p) TO HOUR 	Number of days/hours between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL DAY(p) TO MINUTE 	Number of days/hours/minutes between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL DAY(p) TO SECOND(q) 	Number of days/hours/minutes/seconds between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision and q is the interval seconds precision.
INTERVAL HOUR(p) TO MINUTE 	Number of hours/minutes between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision.
INTERVAL HOUR(p) TO SECOND(q) 	Number of hours/minutes/seconds between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision and q is the interval seconds precision.
INTERVAL MINUTE(p) TO SECOND(q) 	Number of minutes/seconds between two date/times; p is the interval leading precision and q is the interval seconds precision.
